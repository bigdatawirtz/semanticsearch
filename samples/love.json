Love arrives softly, like morning light
slipping through the curtains, warming
the quiet corners we thought were empty.

It grows in the spaces between words,
in the silence that feels safe,
in the simple act of choosing each other again.

And even in the storms, it stays—
a lantern in the wandering night,
a promise that we do not walk alone.
